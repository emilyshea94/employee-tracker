# employee-tracker

## Description
For this challange I usede MySQL and Java Script to creat a working employee tracker. 
This employee tracker allows the user view, change and update employees that I created in a database within the command line.
I used the id's I was given in the criteria instructions to create my own departments, roles and employees.
I had a lot of fun with this challange after getting help from a tutor that better explained the connection between JavaScript and mySQL.
I had difficulty navigationg the MySQL Workbench at first considering it is a new applicaion to me but after successfully building my db.sql and seeds.sql files and implementing them I was able to understanf the functionaliy of this application so much better.

## Usage
When the user types "node index.js" into the command line they are presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
The user can then click on any of those avaible titles and they are able to view or edit the employees on the list.
